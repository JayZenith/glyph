# SFT Built the Agent. RLVR Shifted the Distribution But Didn't Win.

This is where I am ending this round of Glyph.

> SFT built a working Rust tool-use agent. RLVR changed the sampled distribution but failed to improve held-out reliability -- the regression came from training-pool imbalance, not reward design.

Code: <https://github.com/JayZenith/glyph/tree/main>

Glyph is a Rust tool-use agent. The model emits `CALL tool(...)` blocks, tools execute against real Rust crates, and then the model should stop with a clean `FINAL`.

I built Glyph as an end-to-end Rust tool-use agent experiment stack around PRIME-RL: synthetic task generation, SFT trace construction, held-out evals, the real Rust tool harness, RLVR task integration, reward validation, checkpoint export, and final pass@k measurement.

The contract is not just "make cargo pass." The contract is the whole trace:

```text
CALL read_file(...)
RESULT ...
CALL apply_patch(...)
RESULT ...
CALL cargo_test(...) or CALL cargo_run(...)
RESULT status: success
FINAL: ...
```

That is the core lesson:

```text
Verifier RL only works if the verifier matches the full behavior you actually want.
Otherwise, cargo can pass while the agent trace is still unusable.
```

RLVR did not win. SFT built the agent. RLVR changed the sampled distribution, but did not improve the held-out eval reliability on unseen Rust crates.

Each prompt gives the model a crate path and a real tool-use task: patch code until `cargo_test` passes, patch code until `cargo_run` prints exact expected stdout, or simply run an already-correct crate and report the result. The held-out eval mix is:
```text
16 patch_test_pass
24 patch_test_recover
9 patch_run_pass
10 patch_run_recover
5 run_only
5 test_only
```

## The Metric Had To Match the Agent Contract

Early scoring was too loose. A metric called `terminal_tool_success` could
credit a trace whose last successful tool was not a verifier. That is not a coding-agent success.

The metric that mattered became strict `valid_trace`:

```text
valid_trace =
  terminal cargo_test or cargo_run success
  + clean FINAL after that verifier success
  + exact CALL syntax
  + no extra tool use after successful verification
```

If the model passes tests but keeps patching, emits malformed calls, or never finalizes, it is not a usable tool-use agent.

## Debugging the RLVR Harness

Several RLVR attempts failed before the final clean readout. I initially read
the full-finetune regression as destructive RL, but I no longer think that is a
clean conclusion. Those runs still had SFT/RLVR alignment problems: the reward,
chat/tool rendering, and export path were not yet enforcing the exact same
contract as the SFT data and held-out eval. Later LoRA runs were worth debugging, but the first scary regressions
were not all model failures. They were harness failures.

The same lesson showed up three ways:

```text
RL reward must match held-out success.
RL rendering must match the SFT/eval tool protocol.
RL checkpoint export must match the policy actually served during training.
```

Reward first: cargo passing somewhere in the trace is not enough. The highest reward had to require held-out-style success: terminal verifier pass, exact CALL syntax,
clean final, and no tool use after success.

Protocol next: the model was trained on literal ChatML-style tool turns:

```text
<|im_start|>assistant
CALL ...
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>tool
RESULT ...
<|im_end|>
```

**Any deviation is not formatting trivia. It changes the learned task.**

Export was the nastiest one. Two checkpoints appeared to collapse to `0/69`,
but the traces were not random. They had one extra parenthesis:

```text
CALL read_file(id="c1", file_path="..."))
```

Strict eval rejected every malformed call, no tools ran, and the score went to
zero. That looked like RL destroyed the model. **It had not**. The bad repos came
from non-canonical full-weight exports. The served RL policy was base model plus
the broadcast LoRA adapter; `weights/step_N` was not the clean served policy.

The official path became:

```text
outputs/<RUN>/run_default/broadcasts/step_N/
```

exported as a PEFT adapter and evaluated as:

```bash
python -m sft.eval_formal \
  --sft-model JayZenith/SFT_HALF_A \
  --sft-adapter JayZenith/<RLVR_ADAPTER_REPO> \
  ...
```

Only after those fixes did the RLVR result become worth interpreting.

## SFT Was the Main Result

The first strong SFT model, `SFT_V1`, scored:

```text
SFT_V1 strict held-out-69: 52/69
```

That was the first real artifact: a 4B base model learned the
CALL/RESULT/FINAL protocol well enough to edit Rust projects, run cargo
verifiers, and solve most of the held-out set.

Then I tried deeper SFT data. `SFT_V2` added variable-depth recovery. `SFT_V3`
added deeper recovery plus oversampled clean PASS -> FINAL traces.

```text
SFT_V1: 52/69
SFT_V2: 48/69
SFT_V3: 50/69
```

The broad held-out score did not improve. But on the original 17 held-out
problems that `SFT_V1` failed:

```text
SFT_V1: 0/17
SFT_V2: 4/17
SFT_V3: 5/17
```

That was the first tradeoff. Deeper recovery data added hard-tail capability,
but disturbed broad reliability. More difficult traces were not automatically
better. They shifted the policy.

## The Clean Split

That tradeoff is why `SFT_HALF_A` exists. At this point, I stopped trying to
RLVR whichever old SFT checkpoint looked best. To make the experiment clean, I
split `synthetic_data/signal_v3.jsonl` which was used to train SFT_V3 into two deterministic halves.
The SFT and RLVR pool came from this synthetic trace dataset; the held-out eval remained separate unseen Rust crates.

```text
SFT_HALF_A: 1,042 rows, 762 unique case_ids
RL_POOL_B:  1,041 rows, 760 unique case_ids
```

The split was grouped by `case_id`, so oversampled traces for one case could not land on both sides. The counts are from `synthetic_data/signal_v3_split_summary`: the two-case difference is expected because the stratified split kept whole `case_id` groups intact instead of forcing equal unique-case counts.

Leakage checks:

```text
case_id overlap: 0
trace overlap:   0
```

`SFT_HALF_A` trained only on half A and scored:

```text
SFT_HALF_A strict held-out-69 (greedy pass@1 using strict valid_trace): 51/69
```

![Strict held-out-69 scores for SFT models](assets/final_sft_scores.svg)

The clean `SFT_HALF_A` run looked normal:

![SFT_HALF_A training curves](assets/final_sft_training_curves.svg)

That became the baseline. RLVR needed to beat `51/69` on the same strict
held-out eval using non-overlapping pool B.

## The First Clean RLVR Readout

The cleanest early case-level RLVR readout was `RLVR_V1000` step 25, evaluated
through a direct local merge of the broadcast adapter:

```text
SFT_HALF_A:                     51/69
RLVR_V1000 step25 direct merge: 50/69
```

So it did not improve overall.

But it did solve one held-out problem that `SFT_HALF_A` failed:

![V1000 case-level diff](assets/final_v1000_case_diff.svg)


This case matters because it is exactly the kind of recovery loop SFT still struggled with: repeated plausible patches, real verifier feedback, and a limited tool budget that runs out if the model does not reach a solution.

The eval case:

```text
eval100_039_select_event_codes_partial_then_full_fix
kind: patch_test_recover
```


`SFT_HALF_A` got stuck in a repeated read -> patch -> test loop. It made 21
tool calls, never passed the tests, exhausted the budget, and emitted no clean
final.

`RLVR_V1000` made a better fourth patch, got `cargo_test` passing at call `c12`,
and emitted a clean one-line `FINAL`.

That was a real held-out solve under the strict eval: the tools ran, cargo passed, and the trace ended with a clean `FINAL`. But the same checkpoint regressed two cases that SFT solved:

```text
eval100_048_dispatch_action_match_branch_repair
eval100_085_log_window_filter_map_recover
```

The gain and losses looked like the same kind of effect: RLVR shifted fragile recovery paths. One previously failing case found a passing path, while two previously passing cases drifted into failing paths.


The honest claim was:

```text
RLVR changed which recovery loops converge under greedy decoding,
while net aggregate reliability regressed by one: 51/69 -> 50/69.
```

## The Final Clean RLVR Preserved Cargo Solving but Regressed Strict Greedy Validity

The final run had everything verified: a binary reward measured to emit exactly
0 or 10 (with 10 equal to strict held-out validity on every rollout checked), a
chat template byte-identical to the SFT/eval trace format with a launch-time
parity assertion, and the safe adapter export path. The adapter checkpoints
still lost on greedy held-out eval:

![RLVR held-out-69 did not beat SFT_HALF_A](assets/final_rlvr_scores.svg)

```text
SFT_HALF_A:             51/69
RLVR_V999 step 5:       46/69
RLVR_V999 step 10:      45/69
```

## The Final pass@4 Check

The decisive check was held-out-69 pass@4 with the final clean adapter
path: `SFT_HALF_A` versus `SFT_HALF_A + RLVR_V999_STEP10`, same prompts, same
tool budget, same temperature, real cargo execution, separate sandbox per
rollout.

![V999 held-out-69 pass@4](assets/final_v999_passk4.svg)

The result:

```text
SFT_HALF_A valid pass@4 prompts:       59/69
RLVR_V999_STEP10 valid pass@4 prompts: 59/69

SFT_HALF_A valid rollouts:             185/276
RLVR_V999_STEP10 valid rollouts:       190/276

SFT_HALF_A 4/4 stable prompts:         31/69
RLVR_V999_STEP10 4/4 stable prompts:   35/69
```

Prompt-level gains where SFT had zero valid samples and RLVR had at least one:

```text
eval100_014_layered_config_env_does_not_override_explicit_file: 0/4 -> 2/4
eval100_035_record_line_parse_validate_recover:                 0/4 -> 1/4
eval100_039_select_event_codes_partial_then_full_fix:            0/4 -> 1/4
```

Prompt-level losses:

```text
eval100_037_weekly_region_summary_recover:             2/4 -> 0/4
eval100_097_department_expense_summary_report:          1/4 -> 0/4
eval100_099_filter_map_inventory_restock_report:        1/4 -> 0/4
```

The original V1000 signal case, `eval100_039`, shows up in that gains list at
1/4 -- a single-rollout flip, nothing more.

But the aggregate prompt-level result was flat. RLVR increased valid rollout count by five and made four more prompts stable at 4/4, while losing three
prompt-level pass@4 cases. And the rollout-level shift does not clear the noise
floor: at a ~68% success rate, one standard deviation on 276 rollouts is about
8, so +5 is statistically indistinguishable from zero. That is not a win. It is
not even a claimable signal.

The one effect that did reproduce is negative. The two run_only losses
(`eval100_097`, `eval100_099`) kept cargo passing 4/4 while validity fell to
0/4: the policy drifted into copying multiline stdout into `FINAL`, failing
hygiene. The same five run_only cases failed greedy at both step 5 and step 10.
The mechanism is pool composition: run_only and test_only prompts are about 6%
of the RL pool, so almost no training groups exist where the reward can punish
that drift. Nothing in training defends behavior it never samples.

## Decomposing the Loss: Solving vs Finalizing

Scoring the same greedy traces on cargo verifier success alone separates the
two:

```text
                greedy cargo solved    greedy valid_trace
SFT_HALF_A:     51/69                  51/69
V999 step 5:    51/69                  46/69
V999 step 10:   50/69                  45/69
```

RLVR did not degrade Rust solving at all. The entire strict regression is
final-answer hygiene, concentrated in the run_only drift above. Cargo-only
pass@4 even ticked up (60/69 -> 62/69 prompts, 203 -> 205 rollouts), but that
sits inside the same noise floor as everything else, so it is not claimable either.

This is not a reward-contract failure. The reward scored multiline-FINAL
successes exactly 0, verified across every rollout. It is a **training-coverage
failure**: the correct contract had almost no `run_only` groups to apply gradient
to, so unrelated drift in that region went undefended. The fix is data
balance, not reward design.

## Reproduction Checklist

```bash
# SFT baseline
python -m sft.train --data synthetic_data/signal_v3_sft_half_a.jsonl ...

# RLVR (needs a multi-GPU node)
python rl/train.py --model JayZenith/SFT_HALF_A --teacher-model JayZenith/SFT_HALF_A ...

# Strict eval
python -m sft.eval_formal \
  --sft-model JayZenith/SFT_HALF_A \
  --sft-adapter JayZenith/RLVR_V999_STEP10 \
  ...
```

## What This Means

The final readout is:

- SFT is the main result: it learned the exact CALL/RESULT/FINAL protocol and a useful greedy repair prior.
- RLVR shifted the distribution, but did not produce a held-out capability gain.
- Greedy held-out eval has a noise floor of roughly plus or minus three cases on 69 prompts; a one- or two-case RL effect is hard to separate from churn.
- The reproducible failure mode was final-answer hygiene drift from weak `run_only` coverage. The fix is data balance, not reward redesign.

The useful finding is sharper than a simple RLVR win:

```text
Verifier RL only works if the verifier matches the full behavior you actually want.
For tool-use agents, the contract is the whole trace, not just the verifier.
```
