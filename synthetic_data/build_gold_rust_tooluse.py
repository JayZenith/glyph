"""SFT extension: traces for the full RL Rust toolset.

Adds gold examples of:
  read_file → response (inspect a file)
  read_file → apply_patch → cargo_test → response (lib bug fix)
  read_file → apply_patch → cargo_run → response (bin bug fix)
  cargo_check / cargo_build / cargo_test / cargo_run / rustc — single-tool

The output appends to gold_glyph_3000.jsonl so the next SFT run sees the
correct schema for tools the original SFT pool didn't cover (`apply_patch`,
`read_file`, `cargo_build`, `cargo_run`, `rustc`). Format follows the
build_gold50 helpers strictly so docs/glyph.md invariants hold.
